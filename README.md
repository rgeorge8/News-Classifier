# News-Classifier
Created a news classifier that categorised news articles based on their content.
-	Cleaned, lemmatized and removed stop words from document text as part of NLP.
-	Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Embedding), where text documents are converted into vector representations such that each document is represented as a vector in a multidimensional space.
-	Calculated the cosine similarity between two articles to measure their semantic closeness and grouped them based on this.
